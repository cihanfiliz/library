# Library
Library Management System
with Responsive Layout
- Run docker compose up, import book.sql file into mysql and use app from port 3000 (frontend).
- phpmyadmin: port 80, username: root, password: bitnami
- The frontend requires a bit of time to start (at least on my machine)
- There's a minor bug in the frontend's 'Load More Books' button functionality: it loads the remaining data on the second click. I have some ideas on how to fix it, but unfortunately, I've run out of time :) The other parts seem to be working fine.
